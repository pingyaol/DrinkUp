      <h2>Water, water everywhere, but only if we use it wisely</h2>
      <p>Water is a natural resource we have in limited amounts. Freshwater consists of less than 3% of all the water on Earth. 
        A lot of this resource also is not readily available. However, we have also been using it quite lavishly. 
        Every year, each household wastes about 9,400 gallons of water. This much water could have had many other purposes, which will not only benefit the environment but also us.
