      <h2>Water, water everywhere, but only if we use it wisely</h2>

      <h2>Our Purpose</h2>
      <p>Almost half of the adults in America don't drink enough water. The consequence of this can be devastating. 
        Water is the most essential substance for humans as it regulates many functions in one's body. 
        Through DrinkUp, we aim to improve people's health by providing them with reminders to drink water at their desired intervals. 
        Through a built in timer, they will be notified when the alarm goes off.</p>
